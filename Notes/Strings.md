# Format strings
If we want to evaluate inside of a string, we use f strings.

```python
fave_food = input("what's your favouraite food")

print(f"Ooooooo, {fave_food} sonds good!)
```


# String methods
Methods are function we can use on objects.

String methods allow us to modify strings.

for example, we want to make all the characters of a string lowercase.

```python
mr_ubial_yelling = "YOU SHOULD PUSH YOUR CHAIRS IN"

PRINT(mr_ubial_yelling.lower())
```

the . lower() method takes a string and covert all uppercase character to lowercase.
