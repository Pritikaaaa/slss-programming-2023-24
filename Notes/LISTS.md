A list in python is a collection of items
We can store _different_ values in a list
**Order matter** in a list
# Creating a list
To make a list, we use brackets \[\] to surround our list
We separate out the items using ,

```python
some list = ["John", "Tim", "Sara"]
```

# Access elements in a list
We can grab things from list using the bracket notation
In our example above, if I wanted to access "Tim" , I would do the following

```python
some_list[1]    # "Tim"
some_list[2]    # "Sara"
some_list[-1]   # "Sara"
some_list[-2]   # "Tim"
```

Inside the brackets, we say the index of the value that we want
Python uses 0-index counting, which means we start counting from 0
