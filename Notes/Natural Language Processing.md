# Natural Language Processing
## Output
We can use a function to display text and symbols to the screen
We use the `print()` function to display output

```python
print("your text goes in here.")
```
## [[Headers]]

## Comments
Comments are. pieces of text that are not interpreted by python
this means that the text is **ignored**
We use the # symbols to make comments

```
this is a comment
```

# Input
We grab information fro, the user using 
when we run the function, it does two things:
1. It waits for the user to write something or nothing
2. the user presses enter to indicate they are finished

```python
input(<prompt>)

```


# Variables
Variable allows us to store information for the time that our app is running.

```python
favouraite_food = input("what's your favouraite food?")
```

favourite_food -> name of the variable

= -> assignment operator
input... -> value

# Variables
### naming
What you can do:
1. name them with letters, numbers, and underscores
2. names **should** start with lowercase characters

what you can't do:
1. you can't name them with spaces pr symbols.
2. you can't name them with certain names that are reserved
    1. e.g. if, while, for, and, or, ......

A good name is something like this:
```python
favouraite_food
fave_food
date_of_birth
student_number
```

Bad names are like this:
```python
favouraite_food
a
num
aa
aaa
aaaa
aaaaa
aaaaaa
aaaaaaa
aaaaaaaa
```
