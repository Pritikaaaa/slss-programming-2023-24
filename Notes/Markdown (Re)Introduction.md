# Headings
We create headings in Markdown using hash (#) symbols
To create subheadings, we can use multiple hash symbol
## This is a level 2 Subheading
### This is a level 3 Subheading
###### This is a level 6 Subheading

# Modifying Text Style
We use asterisks (\*) to modify text styling, specifically
bold and italics
e.g.
I want this **word** specifically bold
I want this *word* specifically italicized
I want this ***word*** to be both bold and italicized

# Escape characters
**ASIDE**: If we want to place a character that is a 
*keyword* or *reserved word*, we want the literal character, we use the back slash (\\)
   e.g. if we want to put an asterisk, we do this \\\*
# ~Strikethrough
We can also strikethrough characters using the tilde 
I want to strikethrough this specific ~~word
This sentence is struck through

# Links
We can link things in our Markdown files
[One tool to use.](https://chat.openai.com)
Exercise:
* If you have an openai account, do the following:
    * ask chatgpt to create for you markdown code that is a link to two websites of your choice
* if you. don't have chatgpt/openai, create two links to websites of your choice in the space below
   e.g. [my favourite website right now](https://nyt.com)

  e.g. if you use openai
  Put in their code, and in italics say that it's from chatgpt
  [A search engine](https://google.com)*from chatgpt*
  
[google](https://www.google.com) **from chatgpt**
[spotify](https://www.spotify.com)**from chatgpt**

# Images

## Method One
e.g.
![cheetah](https://cdn.britannica.com/98/152298-050-8E45510A/Cheetah.jpg)

# Blockquotes
block quotes allows us to emphasize a bigger chunk of text.
We usr carets (>) to create block quotes.

> this is an example of block quote
> this is line two of block quote
>
>this is line fourth

# Lists
We can create both ordered and unordered list.

# Unordered List 
To create each point, we use (\*) with a space
We can create sublists by placing **TABS** 
e.g.
 * dairy
	 * eggs
	 * milk
	 * cheese
* juice

# Ordered lists
if there is a specific order to the elements in our list 
we create ordered lists
We use numbers, followed by periods to create ordered list

e.g.
1. put butter into mixing bowl
2. add sugar to butter (*hold shift and enter to get the second line*)
   Add both brown and regular sugar
3. use the mixer to cream the butter

# Tables
We can organize information in tables using markdown 
We use dashes (-) and pipes (|)

Tables in markdown require headings

e.g.

| Name      | Age          | Sign            |
| ---       | ---          | ---             |
|pritika    |16            | sag             |
