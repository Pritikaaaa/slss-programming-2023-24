## Recommendation Systems
### Popularity and Likes

This type of paradigm makes a suggestion based on how many people like this thing.

One prime example of this, is the like button (heart) in Instagram.
When you click that heart, Instagram records it, and  based on the information it has on you, it might suggest you to someone else that is similar
to you.

We created the Favourite Bubble Tea service which is based on the "Popularity/Likes" paradigm of recommendation systems.

## N-Point Rating Systems

N-Point Rating Systems are used by many services but one that nearly everyone is familiar with is Amazon's main purchasing service.

This paradigm is where users rate a product of a certain number.

## Similarity Scores

Amazon, Netflix and Meta all use similarity scores to help drive users to their platform.

for e.g. Amazon
> pritika likes ("cinamoroll figurine", "lifeafter", "fries") 
> pri likes ("pochacco figurine", "lifeafter", "fries")

similarity score between pritika and pri is: 2
