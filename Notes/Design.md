_The Design process_ is the step that we take when we create a solution to a problem.

There are four steps in our design process

## 1. design our algorithm in english (or any human language)
An algorithm is a sequence of steps to solve a problem.
In this class, _before_ we start ANY programming, we write our steps in English

## 2. Translate our Algorithm from English to Python
we'll translate our algorithm into "proper" Python.

## 3. Test our Python Algorithm
check if it works syntactically. in other words we check to see if it Breaks
check if it works semantically. in other words, we ask does our algorithm actually solve our problems

## 4. share your work
after it's done ship your work to whoever you want to
